THE BLOCK IO LAYER

block devices have random access of fixed-size chunks of data
      each chunk is a block

eg hard drive, floppy, blu-ray, flash memory
   all of these devices use filesystems

the other type is character device, which have sequential (serial) access
    eg serial ports and keyboards

character devices are simpler, dont require an entire subsystem like the block layer

block devices like hard drives tend to be a lot more performance-sensitive than drivers
      the complexity provides a lot of room for optimization

smallest addressable unit on a block device is a sector, which is a power of 2 but commonly 512 bytes

software has different goals, and imposes a different smallest logically addressable unit -- the block
	 block is an abstraction of the filesystem
	       can be accessed only in multiples of blocks
	 kernel performs all operations in blocks, not sectors
	 	block must be a multiple of sector size
		power of two
		no larger than page size
		common sizes are 512B 1K, 4K
		
aliases for sector
	hard sectors
	device blocks
	
aliases for blocks
	filesystem blocks
	IO blocks

blocks are stored in buffers
       each buffer is exactly the size of a block, which remember is up to a page

each buffer is associated with a descriptor (control information)
     called a buffer_head
