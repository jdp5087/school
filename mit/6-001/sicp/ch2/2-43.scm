###2.43###
------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 2.43.  Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queens procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6Ã— 6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested mappings in the flatmap, writing it as

(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))

Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T.
------------------------------------------------------------

The problem here is that there is a long recursive call placed in the inner loop. Each call other than the top level
(queen calls 8) will result in 8 calls to every step below it. This means that (queens 8) will result in 8 calls to
(queens 7) and 8 calls to (queens 6) for each of those 8 calls. This goes on until (queens 1) and ultimately (queens 0)
will be called 8 times for each call to (queens 1). Therefore, the running time of this algorithm, if the other version
ran in time T. will run in T^8 because the complexity grows by T for each recursive call to the step below.
